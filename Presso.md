#Notes for our standard presentation about Cogbot

# Introduction #

Cogbot is a server written for .NET that connects several avatars acting as "bots" to OpenSim? or Second Life. The system is intended to provide basic features programmers need to populate a prebuilt virtual environments with non player characters doing "interesting" things.

This initial goal does not attempt to define what interesting should mean. But it is important to Cogbot development team to provide, when it can, re-usable tools that several plugin modules can share.

Sometimes creating plugins that are to be part of a toolbox of things that a serious AI program might need.
