= botcmd =

Bot commands are one of the first things that a person can do in Cogbot without learning how to program.  They allow a person to control Cogbot in the virtual world imperatively like "say hi" .. and the bot will say "hi".  They can be used from graphical user interface, the command line, botscript language, AIML, Prolog, Lisp, over the socket, and even httpd.   Best way to learn them is to start using them to do simple things in the world.


== starting ==

So we began with the command line version of cogbot. In Linux
{{{
mono Cogbot.exe --nogui
}}}

or, in Windows start a Command Prompt
{{{
cd \pathtocogbot\
Cogbot.exe --nogui
}}}

If you have already configured your botconfig.xml with a secondlife acct then this may automatically log you on.  Read [botconfig.xml] page for more info.  Quite a bit of debuggish output will happen after entering the above command line that for now we'll forgo the analysis of it.  You can wait for a few seconds for the output to fly past and eventually stop with: 
{{{
0 avatars online: 
}}}


For this example we will assume you have not configured that so that we can show how to log one in fresh.

First we login
{{{
0 avatars online: login ExampleBot Resident pass1234 agni last
}}}

We had very much debug above but for now we are going to concentrate on commands so we will set Debug level to None
{{{
1 avatars online: debug none
Logging is set to None
Success debug
1 avatars online:
}}}
to set less output (we'll still see some having to do things going on in the simulator such as other people taking.

Speaking of which, it is very useful for you to have a second acct logged into the simulator using a graphical client like Imprudence for watching your bot execute the commands.

Setting the buffer width and height to 8000 in the windows cmd box (right click the title bar, Properties, the Layout tab, set Screen buffer size, Width and Height, to 8000) is also useful in cutting down on debug spam.

Lets compare the two commands we used above
"login" and "debug"

Debug was a modal command and executed instantly returning the words:
{{{
Logging is set to None
Success debug
}}}

Then showed the prompt again
{{{
1 avatars online:
}}}

whereas the "login" command started the login to the server but might take a while to complete.

We might typed
{{{
waitforlogin 30
}}}

after the login command.  Which would have told it to stop reading commands for up to 30 seconds until the bot is logged in. 

{{{
1 avatars online: waitforlogin 30
ExampleBot Resident: Korean EduIsland (216.82.44.118:13002)
waitforlogin 0 failures and 1 successes
 1 successes
1 avatars online:
}}}

Since the bot was already logged in the command will complete immediately.

The bot may be in an inconvenient place. To move it, you'll need to be it's master.

When the bot logs in, it should IM you with 'hello master'. If not, you can set yourself as master with

{{{
setmaster ExampleMaster Resident
Master set to ExampleMaster Resident (9eda1cfc-e0c4-41ed-b2d2-e62bb70366df)
}}}

Now simply send the bot a TP request. The bot automatically accepts.

When you're ready to quit, (not now), you can type

{{{
quit
}}}

== Simple Actions ==


We've got a bot standing there, lets make it do things in the world.

type

{{{
say hello world
}}}

and the bot says hello world in local chat

Lets have a sit.

Rez a prim near the bot for it to sit on, and type

{{{
sit
}}}

The bot will sit on it.

{{{
stand
}}}

Makes the bot stand back up.

If you move the prim a little ways away, and type

{{{
sit
}}}

the bot will sit on the ground instead.

You can specify what the bot should sit on.  Name the prim *bot chair*, stand the bot up, and try
Specify Named prim (Notice that you need quotes if there are space)
{{{
sit "bot chair"
}}}

Specify nth closest (the chair 2nd closet to you)
{{{
sit 2 "bot chair"
}}}

You can use UUIDs
{{{
sit ff45-f45-f55-454-f-f45f-fff
}}}

You can use simulator local IDs
{{{
sit lid345345345345
}}}

=== Command Argument reader Impl ===

Prims are read in into a command from three starting points

 * PrimsArg - Reads one argument for a group or single prim
 * ListOfPrimsArgs - Reads each argument like a PrimsArg and concats them together (priminfo select)
 * FilterList (Braces `[`])  - Reads all arguments inside and does a union on all args

Here are examples of a PrimsArg denoting one Prim

{{{
primid345345345
}}}
{{{
1 [attachments]
}}}
{{{
1 "bot chair"
}}}
{{{
$self
}}}
{{{
[$none +primid345345345 ]
}}}


A PrimsArg denoting possibly more than one Prim

{{{
$selected
}}}

these three are all the same
{{{
[$none +primid345345345 +[objects bydist max 2]]
}}}
{{{
[primid345345345 +[objects bydist max 2]]
}}}
{{{
[objects bydist max 2 +primid345345345]
}}}


This would match Zero
{{{
[+ primid345345345 $self [objects bydist max 2 ]]
}}}



Special prefixes that change how command arguments are parsed:
 * + = append to list
 * $ = use a botvar group
 * [ = Start reading 
 * ( = eval a lisp expression and insert it into arg
 * ! = remove the elements denoted by the next arg
 * integer = read the next args and get the "nth" item


A Braced FilterList Starts with either a $group or a +PrimsArg

"$" Single groups are:

 * $master
 * $objects
 * $avatars
 * $accounts
 * $attachments
 * $self
 * $none
 * $selected (items selected by current bot)

For the complete list type:
{{{
/paramhelp 
}}}



{{{
[ $objects mindist 1 maxdist 3 [ not match "red" ] bydist nth 1 ]
}}}

 * distfrom `<loc`>  - sort group by distance to `<loc`>
 * bydist - sort group by distance to avatar (same as "distfrom $self")
 * nth `<1-based`>  - grab only one element (negative numbers search from end)
 * !nth `<1-based`> - remove only one element (negative numbers search from end)
 * keep `<number`>  - retain so many elements (negative numbers retain from end)
 * !keep `<number`> - discard so many elements (negative numbers discard from end)
 * reverse - reverses list order
 * +SingleObject - adds the SingleObject to the group
 * and `<body>` - all preceding elements will be retained `<body`> restarts the group
 * not `<body`> - switches from normally filtering things for retention to removal

Example
{{{
[ not match "red" ]
}}}
is the same as
{{{
!match "red"
}}}


Some commands that take multiple objects such as "look" 

{{{
look [ objects maxdist 3 ]
look primid34343434
}}}

some commands can take multiple objects per single argument 

{{{
/priminfo [ $selected maxdist 2 ]
}}}
the selected prims (that is, the prims in my 'selected' grasper) tha are within 2 meters of my AV 

See all this stuff starting at line 445 of WorldCommandParsing

{{{
/priminfo [ $selected maxdist 2.1 mindist 1.9 max 4 nth2 matches Window !matches "-like" ownedby $master ]
}}}

== Ways of sending bot commands to the bot ==

@: Restrict the following commands to one or all avatars.

== Locations ==

[13:19] BinaBot Daxeline: location formats      simname/x/y/z  
[13:19] BinaBot Daxeline: location formats      x/y/z  
[13:20] BinaBot Daxeline: location formats      "Annie Obscure"
[13:20] BinaBot Daxeline: location formats      "Annie"
[13:21] BinaBot Daxeline: location formats    "ObjectNAme spec" 1
[13:21] bungiecord Burnstein: if it matches more than one
[13:21] BinaBot Daxeline: location formats    nth 1 "ObjectNAme spec"
[13:23] bungiecord Burnstein: at symbol
[13:23] bungiecord Burnstein: angle and distance
[13:33] BinaBot Daxeline: ok /moveto @0*1
[13:33] BinaBot Daxeline: ok /moveto @90*2

nice to have:
match LSL's preferred representation

[13:20] BinaBot Daxeline: location formats      <x,y,z>
[13:20] bungiecord Burnstein: with a space
[13:21] bungiecord Burnstein: so <4.0, 5.0, 18.0>

== PrimSpec ==

Many commands refer to objects. For example

{{{
/touch red cube 1 min 3 dist 6
}}}

causes the bot to touch the nearest red cube that is a minimum of 3 meters away and a maximum of 6 meters distant.

Here's the syntax for specifying an object

{{{
primspec --> single_primspec.
primspec --> single_primspec, primspec.

noun_primspec --> <string>.  % The name of the object
noun_primspec --> <uuid>.  % the UUID of the object

single_primspec --> noun_primspec.
single_primspec --> 

}}}


==More In Issues==

See  issue 9  for a bit more info about format of args

Douglas - feel free to blow this away if you integrate the info
in here

==  Inventory ==

Inventory is referred to by a syntax similar to paths in unix file systems.

Inventory paths start at 'My Inventory' as /.  So a typical set of clothing might be in

/Clothing/My Party Dress

so

wear /Clothing/My Party Dress

The botcmd parser tries to parse correctly without quotes, but you can force it to accept spaces with double quotes

wear "/Clothing/My Party Dress"

It's possible to change the current directory in inventory.

cd /Clothing

and discover the current directory with 

pwd

now you can refer to local path by omitting the leading /

wear "My Party Dress"

. is the current folder

.. is the parent folder, so

if you have 

cd /Clothing/theater/costumes/victorian/ball gown

then you can refer to 

/Clothing/theater/costumes/edwardian

as 

../../edwardian



== Sources for us editors ==

! and $ in commands
$master
$selected   (group of selected prims)
primid is local id
@ coerces prim position to 3d location @primid 15

max is maximum prims in filterset
dist is maximum dist to avatar
/priminfo $selected maxdist 2  
the selected prims (that is, the prims in my 'selected' grasper) tha are within 2 meters of my AV

Passes text to a text-to-speech generator.

DOUG - I'm giving up here. What's with this?

I see it should be surrounded with <sapi>... </sapi> and am puzzled that SSML's root tag is <speak>, and that ultimately it chats rather than voicing the message.
