AIMLBotModulde

= Introduction =

AIML Bot module alows basic system debugging and loading of AIML files.

= Installation =

botcmd: load AIMLBotModule

= Configuration =

When cogbot loads the AIMLBotModule it loads some aiml files from 2 dirrecotries


$cogbin/aiml/shared_aiml/*.*
$cogbin/aiml/firstname_lastname/*.*

if firstname_lastname is not present then it loads from instead $cogbin/aiml/default_bot


one of the4se two direcotties ($cogbin/aiml/firstname_lastname/*.* or $cogbin/aiml/default_bot/*.*) become the personal directory of the bot.


IF both the shared_aiml dir and personal dir was empty, then no aiml files are loaded.


= Use =

At any time a botcmd of 

aiml @load pathto/aimlfile.aiml can be used to load AIML files


= Bot Vars =

{{{
[6:43:16 PM] Anne Ogborn: it's the mechanism I'd use to have Yuppie 'know' in her aiml that she's a woman
[6:43:34 PM] Anne Ogborn: through some aiml get?
[6:43:41 PM] Douglas R. Miles: yes exactly 
when aimlbot is loaded it has a ton of settings like $favfood $hometown all these things can be used in botcmds
[6:44:05 PM] Douglas R. Miles: but the variable is stored in the cogbot memory and not the aiml
[6:44:26 PM] Douglas R. Miles: aiml comes to cogbot memory for these vars
[6:44:54 PM] Douglas R. Miles: why aiml isnt nesisary to load to store these things
[6:45:10 PM] Anne Ogborn: ah
[6:45:21 PM | Edited 6:45:32 PM] Douglas R. Miles: when aiml is loaded it keeps it's settings in cogbot
[6:45:30 PM] Anne Ogborn: I see
[6:46:03 PM] Anne Ogborn: so, for example, lets track $favfood
[6:46:14 PM] Anne Ogborn: where's that initially set?
[6:47:07 PM] Douglas R. Miles: from the aiml config/botvars.xml
[6:47:36 PM] Douglas R. Miles: whereas $master is set from setmaster
[6:48:13 PM] Douglas R. Miles: some varaibles are code calls like $self
[6:48:28 PM] Anne Ogborn: yes, ok
[6:48:48 PM] Anne Ogborn: I don't have a botvars.xml file
[6:48:57 PM | Edited 6:49:06 PM] Douglas R. Miles: i get getter calls a interface that retuns a uncalled function
[6:49:24 PM] Douglas R. Miles: right since you are not runing chatbot sources
[6:49:28 PM] Anne Ogborn: ah, ok
[6:49:39 PM | Edited 6:49:45 PM] Douglas R. Miles: if you are, then it gets copied to your bin directory
[6:49:51 PM] Anne Ogborn: ok, so sounds like this all gets a ref to wiki page for AIML
[6:49:53 PM] Anne Ogborn: 8cD
[6:50:13 PM] Anne Ogborn: lovely!
[6:50:41 PM] Anne Ogborn: brb, potty then do that one
[6:51:20 PM] Douglas R. Miles: http://code.google.com/p/opensim4opencog/source/browse/#svn%2Fdata-chatbot%2Falicebot%2Fconfig
[6:51:44 PM] Douglas R. Miles: oops i meant thbis link: http://code.google.com/p/opensim4opencog/source/browse/data-chatbot/alicebot/config/bot.xml


[7:02:21 PM] Douglas R. Miles: every bot loads that default...
[7:02:45 PM] Douglas R. Miles: then they load aiml/dimebagfurry_resident/*.xml
