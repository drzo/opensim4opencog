= Manifesto =

Cogbot is a server written for .NET that connects several avatars acting as "bots" to OpenSim or Second Life.  The system is intended to provide basic features programmers need to populate a prebuilt virtual environments with non player characters doing "interesting" things.  This initial goal does not attempt to define what interesting should mean.  But it is important to Cogbot development team to provide, when it can, re-usable tools that several plugin modules can share.  Sometimes creating plugins that are to be part of a toolbox of things that a serious AI program might need.

= Principles =

 # Cogbot's intent to be a to be Lego(tm) System for AI developers.
 # We believe that AGI is more likely to come from a confluence of many people's efforts than from a single new theory. Accordingly, we value:

   * Tools for collaboration over isolated demonstrations of AI techniques.

   * Systems that let developers participate in an ecosystem of plugins and tools.

   * Coders getting paid. We won't force collaborators into open sourcing their components when that would limit their ability to contribute.

 # Serve a wide variety of users outside the immediate AGI community, as a robust, flexible, intelligent tool for constructing automatic 'bots' in virtual worlds.
