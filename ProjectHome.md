The goal of this project is to develop an interface to [Opensim](http://www.opensimulator.org) for [OpenCog](http://opencog.org) and other AI systems. It provides a means of connecting external AI bots over a socket to an avatar in the OpenSim Simulator  . It uses TextSL as base and updates it to use libopenmetaverse, and includes DotLisp and a simple task queue processor as a persistent middle layer.
